# AsyncCoreBluetooth Example

This example shows how to create a Central on a cross platform SwiftUI app using AsyncCoreBluetooth. It is designed to connect to the ESP32S3 BLE GATT Server example from espressif.

## ESP32S3 BLE GATT Server

You don't need to set this up to view or run the example. But if you already have an ESP32S3 lying around with the esp idf already installed, then you might as well just flash the example:
